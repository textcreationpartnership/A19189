            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>True it is, that ordinarily the iniuries that are done vnto vs are written in Marble, and the benefits that are ſhewed vnto vs are written in Sand: and as the Aire in the<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 69, 70.</note> High Prieſts Hall did (after a ſort) infect <hi>Peter,</hi> and was an occaſion to his ſoone and ſudden denying of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: ſo euery blaſt of new fauours doth (through our corruption) infect vs with vnthankfulneſſe, and blow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the memory of the former mercies which haue beene ſhewed vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that God expoſtulateth with his people, <hi>Heare, O Heauens, and hearken, O earth, for I haue nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed</hi>

               <note place="margin">Mic. 6. 4, 5.</note>

O my people, remember now what Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lack King of Moab had deuiſed, and what Balaam the ſonne of Beor anſwered him from Shittim to Gilgal.</hi> Yea, hence is it, that good <hi>Moſes</hi> did take ſuch paines with Gods<note place="margin">Deut. 6. 12.</note> people, to preſſe them not to forget the Lord which<note place="margin">Deut. 8. 10. 11.</note> brought them out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but to bleſſe him for the good Land which he had giuen them. And at that time when hee ſaw them tardy in their duty of thankfulneſſe to God, by corrupting themſelues towards him by their vice, how roundly doth hee take them vp, ſaying, <hi>Doe ye ſo reward the Lord, O fooliſh people and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 6.</note>

            <p>All which courſes doe manifeſt vnto vs our proneneſſe to vnthankfulneſſe, yea, and our practice of it alſo (for, what are we better then other people?) Yea, and that we ſtand in neede of continuall prouoking to the good duty of thankfulneſſe, that wee may practiſe it, to the aſſuring of our hearts that greater Plagues then that which we haue had, doe not awaite vs. Therefore is it that I haue choſen this good example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you to this duty at this time, who in the inioyment of ſome great deliuerance from ſome great trouble, in ſome great City, cryed out with a thankefull heart, <hi>Bleſſed bee</hi>

            <p>In his <hi>Prayer,</hi> firſt he ſueth for himſelfe; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, againſt his enemies. For himſelfe, hee prayes to God that he would deliuer him out of his troubles (as from <hi>the hands of his enemies, and from them that perſecute him)</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 1, 15, 16, 17</note> and that <hi>he would make his Face to ſhine vpon him, that hee be not confounded.</hi> And that he may with the more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence depend vpon God for audience, hee doth take a ſuruay of thoſe arguments which may giue incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him to waite vpon God in <hi>Prayer.</hi> Firſt, he doth looke to that confidence and truſt which it hath pleaſed God to worke in his heart, and ſaith, <hi>In thee haue I put my</hi>

Secondly, hee doth looke to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment which Almighty God, in his ſpeciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath taken vpon him for the benefit of the Church in his preſeruation and redemption of it, and ſaith, <hi>Thou

            <p>Thus hath <hi>Dauid</hi> prayed; but he knowes that he who ſues for more, muſt be thankefull for what hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. Therefore now he falleth to the ſecond part of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:655:5"/> Pſalme, which is <hi>Praiſe.</hi> Wherein you may ſee, that firſt, he doth with an holy admiration, ſet out the fauours<note place="margin">Verſ. 19, 20.</note> which God ſheweth <hi>to the ſonnes of God</hi> aboue <hi>the ſonnes</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen 6. 2.</note> 
               <hi>of men</hi> that is, the wicked of the world. <hi>How great is thy goodneſſe which thou ſheweſt to them! Thou hideſt them priuily</hi>

               <hi>in thy preſence, as thy Iewels</hi> in thy Cabinet. Secondly, he doth come to a particular fauor which God ſhewed vnto himſelfe, &amp; bleſſeth God for it. And whereas God might<note place="margin">Verſ 21.</note> ſay, Why (<hi>Dauid</hi>) can <hi>ſweet water and bitter come from</hi>

               <hi>the ſame Fountaine?</hi> Didſt not thou erſt while diſtruſt me? It is true Lord, but it <hi>was my haſte,</hi> and thou wert pleaſed<note place="margin">Verſ. 22.</note> to paſſe it by, and to heare the voice of my prayer when I cryed vnto thee, therefore will I praiſe thee.</p>
            <p>Thus hath <hi>Dauid</hi> praiſed alſo: but he knoweth that it is not enough for him to bee good alone, but hee muſt ſtriue to draw others to be good alſo: therefore in the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24.</note> two laſt verſes hee doth preſſe all Gods people to loue God, and to put their truſt and confidence in God, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, becauſe hee had tried it and found it true by experience, that the Lord <hi>preſerueth the faithfull, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ye haue ſeene in part how <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpent himſelfe thorow this Pſalme. Though we haue ouerlooked it all, yet we are to deale onely with that which doth concerne his praiſe: and not with all that, but only with that Verſe propounded, in which hee breakes out into the praiſe of God for ſome extaordinary fauour which God ſhewed vnto him in a ſtrong City.</p>
            <p>For our better vnderſtanding whereof, reſolue the Text into ſome queſtions and anſwers. What did <hi>Dauid?</hi> He bleſſed Iehourah, who giues being to his ſweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of protection which he hath made vnto his people. But alas, <hi>Dauid,</hi> canſt thou bleſſe God, who alone is the bleſſer of men and Angels? No truly, hee cannot doe it by adding any thing to his happineſſe immediately, as be bleſſeth vs; or by being inſtruments vnder another to further his good mediatly, as man bleſſeth man; but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:655:6"/> by confeſſing to God, and declaring to man with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and reuerence, what happineſſe we doe receiue from God. And this it pleaſeth God to account a bleſſing of him, to encourage and draw vs on to make our ſelues the more happy by cleauing vnto him by thankſgiuing. Yea, but for what doth <hi>Dauid</hi> bleſſe God? For ſhewing him kindneſſe or mercy. It was ſome ſpeciall deliuerance from ſome great danger, as from the cruelty of <hi>Saul,</hi> tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chety of his Courtiers, or the like. Yea, but of what worth was this fauour that he ſhewed <hi>Dauid? It was his maruellous kindneſſe.</hi> Thus did he prize his fauour hee did receiue. As <hi>Peter</hi> did weigh his ſinnes, that his godly<note place="margin">Mar. 14. 72.</note> ſorrow might ſinke the deeper: ſo did <hi>Dauid</hi> weigh his kindneſſe, and found it to be Gods, and found it to bee maruellous, that his thankfulneſſe might riſe the higher. Yea, but where did <hi>Dauid</hi> receiue his maruellous kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God? <hi>In a ſtrong City.</hi> Whether in a City or no City it is doubted. Therefore ſome doe vnderſtand it by way of ſimilitude, that the kindneſſe was ſuch, as if hee had beene kept in a City of ſtrong defence. But I know no inconuenience, in thinking that <hi>Dauid</hi> felt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of ſome walled Towne, as when he fled to the holds of the Philiſtims, or the like, becauſe the words are ſo pregnant. Howſoeuer this we are ſure of, that if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect vpon our ſelues, and in this Glaſſe of Gods kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſee the loue of God vnto vs, who, amongſt many other fauours, hath heard the grones and ſighs of his people for the poore City of <hi>London,</hi> where ſo many thouſands haue beene ſwept away as the Dongue of the ſtreets, we may iuſtly ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, for hee hath ſhewed maruellous kindneſſe towards vs in this our City.</hi> As if we ſhould ſay, It is true, Lord, <hi>thou haſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhewed thy</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 60. 3, 4.</note>

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>euen from the Snare of thy hunting</hi> Angell: thou

            </p>
            <p>This bleſſing of God is the nayle which I would haue driuen home at this time. Therefore I ſhall paſſe by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which might afford vs matter of meditation from theſe words, and onely inſiſt vpon this point; <hi>That </hi>

               <hi>By how much greater the fauor is which God beſtoweth vpon vs, by ſo much more muſt we labour to praiſe God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two things propounded here: the firſt is this, That the greater our fauour is, the greater ought to be our thanks. Therefore <hi>Dauid,</hi> hauing receiued a great fauour from God (namely, the forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes, though as yet he could not feele the comfort of it) and fearing that he was not able to praiſe God anſwerable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, prayeth to God <hi>that hee would open his lips that his</hi>

               <hi>mouth might ſhew forth his praiſe.</hi> And again, vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the like fauours, hee doth ſtirre vp his ſoule greatly to the ſame duty, <hi>My ſoule praiſe thou the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 103. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>and all that is within me praiſe his holy name: my ſoule praiſe thou the Lord, and forget not all his benefits;</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he doth reckon vp: yea, and when he doth find his heart inlarged by God to practiſe the duty, then doth he imploy all his powers, ſaying, <hi>Seuen times a day doe I praiſe</hi>

            <p>The ſecond thing propounded is this, that euery fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour from God doth call for thankes from vs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it a duty which is often preſſed and patterned in the Scriptures. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>let your requeſts be ſhewed

            <p>It may be now you will aske me, why we muſt thus la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour<note place="margin">Why we muſt praiſe God.</note> to praiſe God? I anſwer, wee muſt doe it both in reſpect of our ſelues, in reſpect of others, and in reſpect of the duty of thankfulneſſe it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, in reſpect of our ſelues; becauſe it is all that wee are able (and that from God too) to render vnto God for all the benefits which we receiue from God. <hi>Dauid</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with himſelfe what he ſhall render vnto the Lord for all his benefits towards him; reſolueth, that hee hath nothing but the <hi>Cup of ſaluation,</hi> ſo alluding to the<note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 12, 13.</note> Peace-offrings, which were offerings of thankgiuing to God. When therefore we doe conſider, that God is not bound vnto vs (for <hi>who hath giuen him firſt?</hi>) and that<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 35.</note> whatſoeuer wee doe receiue from God is of his free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, can we doe leſſe for ſhame then giue him thankes?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, we muſt doe it in reſpect of others, &amp; them, both God &amp; men. Firſt, we muſt praiſe God in reſpect of God himſelfe: becauſe God requireth it as the end of his bleſſings, and that which ſanctifieth them vnto vs. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God deliuered the Iſraelites out of Aegypt, hee<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> commanded that euery yeere they ſhould keepe the feaſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:655:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the Paſſeouer; the old Perſons as it was a Sacrament, and the young Perſons as it was a remembrance of their deliuerance out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And when God fed them with<note place="margin">Exod. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Mannah,</hi> hee appointed that a certaine meaſure of it ſhould be laid vp for poſterity, that they might be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; which was alſo the reaſon of the laying vp of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron his Rod</hi> in the Arke.

Secondly, God maketh ſpeciall account of this duty, and therefore hee vſeth many means to work it from his people. In <hi>Exodus</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 23. 16.</note> yee reade of that generall offering of <hi>firſt fruits in the feaſt of vnleuened bread,</hi> when none muſt appeare before God<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 1, 2, &amp;c.</note> empty: and likewiſe of the voluntary gifts for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Tabernacle. In <hi>Leuiticus</hi> ye reade ſometimes of offering the firſt fruits of <hi>the eares of Corne</hi> dryed by<note place="margin">Leuit. 2. 24.</note> the fire: ſometimes of offering <hi>a ſheafe of the firſt fruits of</hi>

               <hi>the Harueſt</hi> to be brought vnto the Prieſt: ſometimes of <hi>the ſhake offring of two Loaues,</hi> baked with Leuen for firſt fruits vnto the Lord.

               <note place="margin">Numb. 25. 20.</note> we reade of the firſt of all the <hi>fruit of the earth, that</hi>

               <hi>muſt put it in a Basket, and carried to the place which the Lord did chooſe.</hi> Now, why doth the Lord require all this of his people? Surely this is one reaſon, that hee might ſhew what reckoning he makes of thankfulneſſe for all the mercies which we receiue from his hand. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt we be thankfull.</p>
            <p>Againe, we muſt praiſe God in reſpect of men, both bad and good. If we looke to bad men, they doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage themſelues to be thankfull to <hi>the gods of ſiluer and</hi>

And this may bee ſeene in foure particulars. Firſt in this, that our God doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a gift, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Giue vnto the Lord glory</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 29. 2.</note>

               <hi>our God? For all things come of thee, and of thine owne hand we haue giuen thee.</hi> Yet it pleaſeth God to account them gifts: and we know <hi>that it is a more bleſſed thing to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 20 35.</note> 
               <hi>giue then to receiue.</hi> Secondly, God doth not onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count our praiſe a gift, but a ſacrifice (the beſt gift:) as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Let them offer ſacrifices of praiſe.</hi> Yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member<note place="margin">Pſal. 107. 22.</note> that it is not a ſacrifice of redemption (for ſo is Ieſus Chriſt alone) but of thankſgiuing.

Oh therefore let vs labour (as wee are bound) to take notice of the fauours of God, and to make a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of them, to prouoke our ſlothfull hearts to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and thankfulneſſe! How came it to paſſe that the Iſraelites were ſo vnthankfull? Surely, <hi>they forgat God</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 21.</note> 
               <hi>that made them,</hi> and the ſtrong God of their ſaluation. Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Remember the Lord thy God, for it</hi>

               <hi>is he who giueth thee power to get riches.</hi> And afterwards <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> puts them in minde of Gods benefits, both before the Law and after the Law, as yee may ſee in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent<note place="margin">Ioſh. 24. 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.</note> Parliament ſpeech which hee made before his death. So let vs lay the mercies of God before vs, that wee may be moued to be thankfull.</p>
            <p>To this end (that I may giue a little light) let vs behold God, either giuing of vs fauours, or remouing miſeries from vs. If we would a little ſee his fauours, let vs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ſelues liuing a fourefold life. The firſt is, a life of vegetation, whereby wee grow: and this putteth vs in minde of a double benefit. Firſt, that God hath not made thee a Dwarfe, or imperfect man of parts, but hee hath giuen thee the full feature and proportion of a man, that thou maiſt be able to doe all the buſineſſe of a man. If thou hadſt not this, thou wouldſt ſee the worth of it.<note place="margin">Carendo magis quàm fruendo.</note> If thou wert as little <hi>Dauid</hi> to combat with <hi>Goliah;</hi> or if thou didſt dwell among the ſonnes of <hi>Anak;</hi> or if <hi>Og,</hi> the<note place="margin">Deut. 3 11.</note> King of Baſhan ſhould ſet vpon thee, who was <hi>of the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Gyants, and had his bed nine cubits long, and foure cubits broad,</hi> according to <hi>the cubit of a man,</hi> it would trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee much: but God hath prouided better for thee, for thine, and for thy Countries good. Yea, ſecondly, God hath not made thee <hi>fire, and haile, and ſnow, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 148. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and winde.</hi> If hee had but made vs a Hailſtone, yet we muſt haue praiſed him according to our creation; how much more now, God hauing giuen vs life.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, is a life of ſenſe, whereby wee heare, ſee,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:655:10"/> ſmell, and the like, as beaſts doe: and this putteth vs in minde of a threefold benefit. Firſt, that God hath giuen vs the comfort of our ſenſes. If by Sight thou couldſt not diſcerne colours; by Hearing, ſounds; by Feeling, ſubſtances, qualities and quantities; by Smelling, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours; and by Taſting, meates; though wee had neuer ſo much wiſdome, wee would thinke our ſelues halfe dead, and no better then obiects of ſcorne and pitty. Yet God hath not onely giuen vs this but more: for ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee hath giuen vs a full meaſure of naturall delights for all our ſences. There are variety of Flowers to fill thy ſmelling, chaunting of Birds to delight thy hearing, vnmatchable Colours for thy eye, infinite variety of Meates for thy taſte, and ſoft and hard, hot and cold ſubſtances for thy touching. Yea, and more then this: Thirdly, he hath made vs the nobleſt compoſition of all ſenſitiue creatures. God might haue made vs a Dragon in the deepe, a Toade in the earth, an Owle in the aire, and a Boare in the Forreſt, but he hath made vs men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>after his owne Image,</hi> though wee haue defiled it.<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 27.</note> Yea, and though hee hath made Plants to excell vs in<note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> grouth, and Beaſts in particular ſenſes; as a Dogge in ſmelling, a Hawke in ſeeing, a Spider in touching, and an Hare in hearing; yet in all theſe Senſes, no creature is like vnto man.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, if to theſe we adde the life of reaſon, then Gods kindneſſes are greater: for by it wee are put in minde of a double benefit. For firſt, he hath giuen vs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be a Ruler (at the leaſt ſometimes) to all the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour powers of the ſoule. If the will ſhould be alwaies an abſolute Monarch of it ſelfe, it would turne Tyrant, and make vs vtter that imperious voice, <hi>So I will, ſo I</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dictaſapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</note> 
               <hi>command, my will ſhall be my Councellor and wiſdome.</hi> If the affections ſhould gouerne, the Lawes <hi>would not bee the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iuraplebeia.</note> 
               <hi>ſayings of the wiſe, but the decrees of the heady multitude.</hi> And what could follow but confuſion, when euery man would doe what he liſt. For the redreſſe of which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:655:11"/> Almighty God hath giuen vs Reaſon. Yea, and ſecondly, he hath giuen vs a ſound minde, or our wits, as we call it. If we were fooles, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit himſelfe to be before <hi>Achtſh</hi> in its ſlaueting moode; or as <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> whom God depriued of his wits for a ſeaſon, we were worſe then beaſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and euery man (I thinke) would rather wiſh alwaies to mourne, hauing his wits about him, then alwaies to laugh and to bee merry without them. Behold then, God hath giuen them vnto vs, bleſſed be God.</p>
            <p>Yet here God hath not left to be kinde vnto vs. For, if (laſtly) we conſider the life of Religion, wee know not where to beginne with Gods fauours, nor where to make an end. We might ſpeake of being borne of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Parents, <hi>to bring vs vp in the inſtruction and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 6.</note> 
               <hi>of the Lord:</hi> of being brought vp in a moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, where we are entred into the publike fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Saints by Baptiſme, and nouriſhed by the Word of God and the Euchariſt: of liuing vnder a moſt worthy and religious King, vnder whom we haue peace, and the Goſpell, and a greater meaſure of plenty then we deſerue. Theſe and many other I might ſpeake of, and I pray God that the commonneſſe of theſe benefits do not make vs to ſlight them: but I muſt not be infinite. Therefore briefly call to minde, that (firſt) from God the Father we haue the bleſſing of all his Attributes, by his diuine influence, doing of vs good: as of his truth in keeping promiſe; of his mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in accepting the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of, Chriſt for ours; of his Iuſtice, in bringing tribulation to them that trouble vs; and of his Wiſdom, in finding a meanes in Chriſt to make his Mercy and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice meet together for our ſaluation, and ſo of the reſt. Secondly, from God the Son wee haue raſted ſuch loue, <hi>greater then which, knowes no man, that one ſhould dye for his</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 15. 13.</note> 
               <hi>enemy.</hi> Yea, and this his loue he hath manifeſted by his<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note> obedience <hi>Actiue</hi> and <hi>Paſſiue</hi> to the Father for vs: as it is<note place="margin">Pſal. 40 6, 7, 8.</note> written, <hi>Behold, I come. In the volume of thy Booke it is<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:655:11"/> written of me, that I ſhould doe thy Will, O God.</hi> Yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he doth maintaine all this good, which hee hath done for vs, by the power which the Father hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, whereby hee ruleth in vs, and ouer-ruleth our enemies. Thirdly, from God the holy Ghoſt, wee haue the <hi>Wiſdome of Chriſt</hi> applyed vnto vs by teaching:<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 13.</note> We haue the <hi>Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt</hi> applyed vnto vs by<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 24.</note> vnion: We haue the <hi>Holineſſe of Chriſt</hi> applyed vnto vs by<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 5.</note> regeneration: We haue the <hi>learned tongue of Chriſt</hi> apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Eſay.</note> vnto vs by comfort: And the full <hi>Redemption of Chriſt</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 16.</note> applyed vnto vs, by aſſuring our hearts that wee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 22.</note> and that no man ſhall take our ioy from vs. Laſtly, from the whole Trinity we haue this benefit, that though all the earth be Gods, yet we are <hi>his inheritance, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 9.</note> 
               <hi>people, his Iewels, his chiefe Treaſure.</hi> This ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth<note place="margin">Deut. 26. 18.</note> vs vp, and it may thus bee valued, that the Saints<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 16, 17.</note> of God, who were wiſer then we, haue rather choſen to<note place="margin">Pſal. 135. 4.</note> be ſeruants of God with ſorrow, then otherwiſe to bee in great places without it, as <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus haue I ſtirred you vp, to look vpon God, giuing of vs fauours. Now doe but caſt your eyes about, vnto more kindneſſes, and ſee him remouing miſeries from vs. And this I ſhall ſhew in two particulars: Firſt, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering vs from our enemies both at home and abroad: and ſecondly, in a comfortable abating and remouing by degrees the fearefull infection of the Plague. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gods deliuering vs from our enemies (I thinke) no man can doubt that it is a maruellous kindneſſe. Therefore <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> when he was ready to dye propheſied of<note place="margin">Gen. 50. 24.</note> it for the Iſrelites, and God in a ſpeciall manner came downe from Heauen to ſend <hi>Moſes</hi> about it: and the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 8, 16.</note> were aſſigned to keepe the memory of it vpon a<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> ſet day: and <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a thing worthy the ſpeaking of,<note place="margin">Exod. 18. 8.</note> told <hi>Iethro</hi> of it, and often rubbed it vpon the Iſraelites, that they might not forget it. But there are two things aboue the reſt, which doe make it to bee a great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:655:12"/>
            <p>Firſt, that God did not deliuer his people of old (or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily) but at their great and earneſt ſuite. Sometimes hee left them twenty, ſometimes forty, and ſometimes ſeuenty and more yeeres vnder their enemies hands, that they might cry aloud, ſtretch out their throats till they were hoarſe, and waite vpon God. Now things deareſt bought and hardeſt come by, are vſually (as we ſee) moſt precious.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider that the oppreſſions of an enemy doe extend both to body and ſoule. When <hi>Sampſon</hi> fell into his enemies hands, they <hi>put out his eyes, bound him in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iud. 16. 21.</note> 
               <hi>fetters,</hi> and <hi>made him grinde in the priſon houſe. Abel</hi> in<note place="margin">Gen. 4, 8.</note> 
               <hi>Cains</hi> hands came to an vntimely death. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the power of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were cauſed to ſerue and made weary of their liues. <hi>Naaſh</hi> the Ammonite, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing<note place="margin">Exod. 1. 13, 14.</note> aduantage ouer the men of <hi>Iabeſh-Gilead,</hi> would<note place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 2.</note> haue all <hi>their right eyes, that hee might bring ſhame vpon Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. Haman</hi> being prouoked by <hi>Mordecay,</hi> thought it<note place="margin">Eſt. 3. 6.</note> too little to hang him except he rooted out all the Iewes. The King of <hi>Babel</hi> hauing <hi>Zedechiah</hi> in his hands, <hi>ſlew his</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 52. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>ſonnes before his eyes, put out the eyes of Zedechiah, bound him in chaines, and carried him to Babylon.</hi> But what, doth the oppreſſion of an enemy goe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no further then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? Yes, theſe things cannot, but by way of ſympathy, ſad the Spirit: Yea, and it makes <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſweare by the life of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and draweth fearefully to ſinne; as God knowes how many the popiſh yoke hath made to ſhake hands with Conſcience for the preſent, vntill this tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be ouerpaſt, and to bow the knee to that curſed Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Baall.</p>
            <p>In theſe reſpects is the hand of an enemy a grieuous burthen: yet hath our good God (in whom alone wee muſt truſt) deliuered vs from it both paſt and approching. As for times paſt, how powerfull and louing hath God ſhewed himſelfe, in <hi>ſmiting our enemies vpon the cheeke</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 3. 7.</note> 
               <hi>bone,</hi> and diſappointing them of their hopes. Some through maleuolence would haue brought diſgraces to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:655:12"/> our perſons, troubles to our liues, vnquietneſſe to our mindes by vnchriſtian aduantages and politique wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſimple, tolerable, and good actions to badneſſe, as the Ieſuites declamations may witneſſe: yet bleſſed be God, we ſtand in the ſame condition as before. And doe wee not call to minde the proud Armado of Spaine in eighty eight, which was (to no purpoſe) called Inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible? We were like the Iſraelites, two little flocks of Kids, and they like the Aramites, who couered the Sea. They laughed at our handfulls, and confidently expected our ruine: but he <hi>that ſits in Heauen laughed them to ſcorn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord had them in deriſion;</hi> he brake the ſnare, and we were deliuered. And can we euer forget that Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der plot of Gods and our enemies, which ſhould haue beene the ruine of Prince and people? Who could deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs from this but God? He that muſt do it, muſt haue <hi>praeſcience</hi> to foreknow the miſchiefe, wiſdome to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant it, and power to withſtand it: And where are theſe but in God, and in them to whom God leudeth them?</p>
            <p>Thus hath God defeated our enemies in times paſt, and hath he not done ſo for the preſent? It is not long ſince Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiticall brags were euidences of their hopes, &amp; their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings of an aſſurance of a triumphant day: but God hath once more driuen thoſe ſtout Confeſſors heads into an hole. And it is but as yeſterday that our hollow friends beyond the Seas looked towards vs, either to affright vs, or elſe, as from the top of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> to looke towards our Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> with a deſire to plant themſelues, and root out vs and our poſterity: but as <hi>Saul</hi> had tidings which drew him from the Wilderneſſe of <hi>Maon:</hi> ſo there was a Flea in their eare, which (bleſſed bee God) hath for the preſent ſent them another way. <hi>So, euen ſo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iud. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Lord, let thine enemies periſh,</hi> be conſounded or diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtill.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as God hath beene kinde in remouing the miſery of our enemies abroad, ſo of a wonderfull abating the Plague of Peſtilence at home. The grieuouſneſſe of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:655:13"/> the euill will make the more for the greatneſſe of the deliuerance. And that the Plague is a grieuous euill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, our wofull experience (I thinke) theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will make good: Firſt, it is a <hi>powring out of Gods</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 14. 19.</note>

               <note place="margin">Ezek. 38 22.</note> 
               <hi>with peſtilence and bloud,</hi> as the Prophet calleth it. And it may be called ſo, either becauſe it poyſoneth the bloud, ſo as no diſeaſe doth the like, or elſe becauſe in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall (though not in euery particular vpon whom it ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth) it is an argument of an angry God, who will not bee pacified with the light skirmiſhes of Feuers, Aches, Gouts, Rheumes, and the like, but will haue bloud, and that in abundance, and ſtremes anſwerable to the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which haue gone before; as when he ſaith, <hi>Hee will make his Arrowes drunke with bloud, and his Sword ſhall eat</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 42.</note> 
               <hi>fleſh.</hi> Secondly, it is the Plague of wofull euils, or the <hi>noiſome Peſtilence,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt calleth it. For it poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth<note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 3.</note> the ſpirits, both Animall and Vitall, choking the one in the braine, and ſtifling and ouercomming the other in the heart: yea, it Infecteth Houſes, Clothes, Breath, and the Aire it ſelfe. It is true, that I doe not thinke it naturally to haue ſuch a malignant quality as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poyſons haue; for then (as they doe in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees or other) it would ſeaze vpon all perſons where it comes, which it doth not, but according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which (as a ſeruant) it hath from God to doe his pleaſure: yet that it noyſomly infecteth (I thinke) wee haue no iuſt cauſe to doubt, if we conſider that God ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his extraordinary prouidence on worke, to keepe them <hi>that truſt in him</hi> (if they haue not done all that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 4.</note> which he hath for them in this world) from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it. Thirdly, that it is the <hi>terrour of the night</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 5, 6.</note> which is ſo much the more terrible becauſe (like a thiefe) it walketh in the darke, and ſurpriſeth a man before he is aware. Hence is it that it breeds a ſtrangeneſſe betwixt Father and Son, Mother &amp; Daughter, Brother &amp; Brother, one friend and another. Hence is it that ſome in places of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:655:13"/> danger grew cruell, &amp; others not in ſo great danger grew vnkind. Hence is it that there is flight on all ſides in times of infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The wicked do fly out of raſhnes, &amp; contempt of Gods ſtroke, like rebellious ſons, who, when they ſee that their father hath prouided a Rod for them, do run out of the houſe from him, &amp; will neither ſubmit to his corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction nor amend their faults for which he doth correct them. Oh too many ſuch fly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Plague out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; are plagues vnto the Country by diſorderlineſſe. But theſe muſt know, that if they bee now appointed vnto death, Gods hunter ſhal bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the ſnare: if not, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they ſhall with bleeding ſoules amend their wayes, God hath reſerued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for greater miſeries. The good do flye out of humble ſubmiſſion, to the vſe of thoſe means, which daly experience warrants to be the way to ſafety, at ſome times, and to ſome perſons. Therefore like fearefull children (yea, and good ones too) when they ſee their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reach downe a Rod, they run away, not out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, but with deep cries &amp; lamentations, out of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of nature, ſorrow for offence, and hope of pardon: ſo ſometimes Gods good children doe flye alſo, but with humblings in the ſight of God, for the weakneſſe of their faith, want of preparedneſſe to meet God, and the like; and doe in their abſence, not thinke themſelues ſo ſafe, but that God may ſmite them; and therefore they ſpend much time in deprecating the wrath, in mourning with them that mourne, and (to their power) in relieuing the neceſſities of their forſaken brethren that are in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Theſe three things (if we ſpeake of no other) doe either make or ſhew the Plague to be a grieuous euill: yet ſome of vs may ſay with the Pſalmiſt, which ſome change, <hi>A thouſand hath fallen beſides mee, and ten thouſand at my</hi>

            <p>You haue now (ſo farre as I intended) as in a little Map, a glimpſe of the world of thoſe kindneſſes which God hath ſhewed to vs. Let vs take heede that wee doe not diminiſh the worth of them.

            </p>
            <p>If you ſhal aske me, What good it wil do vnto vs thus to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:655:14"/> behold God in his mercifull kindneſſes vnto vs? Truly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will be excellent meanes to ſubdue the pride of our hearts, and to make vs ſeruiceable to Gods will. The power of God alone doth it not, for though Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his power, yet it did no good to them that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended him; they <hi>went backward and fell to the ground</hi> at<note place="margin">Iohn 18. 6.</note> his very word, yet they perſiſted in their courſe. The iuſtice of God doth it not, for though God brought one Plague after another vpon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> which made him ſtoope for the preſent (as many haue done, I feare, in this Plague) yet preſently he hardned his heart: but if the mercy of God comes, it is like the Sunne which thawes hard Ice, and the Fire, which makes old Wax ſoft, pliable, and fit to be wrought vpon. Though Iuſtice follow vs to Hell, yet there is blaſphemy and gnaſhing of teeth, both which are arguments of pride: But <hi>Paul</hi> knew how forceable an argument this was, <hi>I beſeech you by the mercies of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Is not my word</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>like an hammer and like fire?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 23. 29.</note> The Law which bringeth tidings of Iuſtice, may like a Hammer breake our ſtony hearts in pieces (breake, I ſay, before bend) but the Goſpell (bringing the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of ſaluation by Chriſt) like fire will melt vs and mould vs anew. This will breede the ſpirit of iudgement (as <hi>Dauids</hi> kindneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made <hi>Saul</hi> iudge him more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous then himſelfe) and the <hi>ſpirit of burning to clenſe</hi> out<note place="margin">Eſa 4. 4.</note> and purge away the filth of ſinne, that the graces of God may be ſhed into vs, or (at the leaſt) ſhine from vs, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt this iuſt thankfulneſſe.</p>
            <p>Well (ſay you) I ſee that God (bleſſed for euer) hath beene maruellous kinde vnto me, I haue heard and felt many particulars of it, and I ſee that the thought of it is of excellent vſe to breake my proud heart, and make mee thankfull to God: I pray now tell mee wherein muſt I ſhew my thankfulneſſe to God? I anſwer, to giue you a little helpe herein, I muſt firſt lay downe the root and ground of thankfulneſſe; and ſecondly, the practiſe of it. As for the root of thankfulneſſe, It is <hi>the loue of God.</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:655:15"/> No man will freely and ioyfully acknowledge, that all goodneſſe, in what eſtate ſoeuer comes from God alone, except we loue God. We ſee ordinarily, if men happen to receiue kindneſſes from them they loue, or deſire not to be beholding vnto, how they pinch courteſie (as wee ſay) and ſlight them: whereas, if wee doe receiue them from ſuch as we prize in our affections, then euery Mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill is a Mountaine, and a point from a friend is better then a pound from an enemy. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> louing <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> did freely acknowledge their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 4.</note> ſaying, They haue <hi>for life, yea for my life, layed downe a necke,</hi> yea, <hi>their owne necke,</hi> vnto whom not onely <hi>I giue thankes, but all the Churches of the Gentiles.</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he had profeſſed, ſaying, <hi>I loue the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 1, 12.</note> he preſently ſheweth it, and ſaith farther, <hi>What ſhall I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto the Lord for all his benefits?</hi> Oh therefore let vs labour to winde vp our hearts from the <hi>loue of the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Iohn 2. 15.</note> and the things which are in the world, that the <hi>loue</hi> of the Father <hi>may be in vs.</hi> And (if we deſire to be thankfull) let vs not giue either God, or our ſoules reſt, till we haue found this loue in vs in theſe fiue particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, in taking any paines, and induring any hardneſſe for Gods ſake. As <hi>Iacob</hi> did thinke <hi>ſeuen yeeres</hi> trouble<note place="margin">Gen. 29. 20.</note> nothing for <hi>Rachel, becauſe he loued her;</hi> and Gods people of old haue indured the loſſe of Father, Mother, Houſes, Lands, Wife and Children for Chriſts ſake, becauſe they loued him: ſo muſt we (euery day, and vpon the Lords day, in liuing the life of Ieſus, and dying for the Lord when he calleth) ſuffer any thing for the Lord, if we loue him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, in ſetting our hearts towards him and vpon him; for <hi>where our Treaſure is, there will our hearet be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi>

               <hi>loue thy Law!</hi> he preſently addeth, <hi>It is my meditation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually:</hi> ſo when wee can ſay, That wee loue God, our

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in highly eſteeming the pledges of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour which he hath left with vs, to wit, the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. If the wounded Iew in the Parable ſhould haue caſt away the <hi>two pence</hi> which the Samaritan left to<note place="margin">Luke 10. 35.</note> prouide for him, it had bene an argument that he neither regarded him nor his kindneſſe; and it was a ſigne that <hi>Eſau</hi> loued not God, becauſe he eſteemed not his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: So certainly is the Law of God farre from vs, if we loue not <hi>the word,</hi> wherein wee heare our louer ſpeake, and the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> wherein wee ſee him ſpeake peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in being humbly familiar with God, <hi>and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 12. 21.</note> 
               <hi>our ſelues with him.</hi> Where there is loue free from<note place="margin">Iob 12. 21.</note> iealouſie betwixt man and man, they thinke themſelues neuer better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they are in one anothers company, talking, and communing one with another, laying open each other griefes, and making one another partaker of each others comforts. So we muſt haue ſuch intereſt in Gods acquaintance, if we loue him, that we muſt often <hi>ſup with him,</hi> and open our hearts vnto him, both concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 20.</note> our miſeries and our ſinnes. As if wee ſhould ſay; thou ſeeſt (Lord) what ſorrowes I endure within and without: I beſeech thee giue me grace ſo to carrie my ſelfe, as thou mayeſt haue the glorie of this thine owne worke. And thou knoweſt (ô my God) that I haue this infirmitie, or that weakeneſſe, and that were it not for thee, I ſhould fall into fearefull breaches of thy Law: but Lord helpe me againſt this or that (as againſt pride, vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie, deceite, hypocriſie and the like) that I may in a more ſetled and conſtant courſe honour thee my good God, to whom I am ſo infinitely bound. Oh, how would ſuch acquaintance make the day of death welcome, and our daily prayers comfortable, without which we haue
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:655:16"/> little hope to haue acceſſe to God in either.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, we muſt loue God by fearing to loſe him, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing after him, when in ſenſe and feeling he is loſt, and caring to recouer him againe. It is ſtrange that a man<note place="margin">Diſcat timere qui vult amare. Amor eijcit ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morem inimici, non timorem do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</note> ſhould loue by fearing: but it is very true. Perfect loue caſteth out feare of hauing, to wit, the wrath of God for ſinne, (becauſe, after repenting and belieuing the Goſpell, it quiets the heart from ſuch troubles) but it caſteth not out feare of looſing, to wit, our God in thoſe ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, whereby hee ſpeakes peace vnto our conſciences, and ſayeth vnto our ſoules that he is our ſaluation. <hi>Bleſſed</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 19.</note> 
               <hi>is he that ſo feareth alwaies,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon.</hi> As <hi>Pilate</hi> loues<note place="margin">Iohn 19.</note> his place by fearing to looſe it, which made him do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt<note place="margin">Quod cupis ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere times per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere.</note> his conſcience when once he heard that ſpeech. <hi>If thou deliuer Chriſt, thou art not Caeſars friend:</hi> So muſt wee loue God ſo, as wee muſt feare to looſe him aboue all things. Yea and as the young man in the Goſpell, which<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 22, 23.</note> was a rich man, when he did but thinke of parting with all and following Chriſt, was very heauie, becauſe he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his riches too well: ſo when we do but thinke of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with our God (who is our <hi>Portion</hi>) it cannot but<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> grieue vs, if wee loue him and prize him as wee ſhould. Yea and againe, if the Spouſe in the Canticles, when through her ſecuritie ſhe had ouerſlipped the golden ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of entertaining Chriſt, who therefore withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Did ſeeke him (whom her ſoule loued) but could not find</hi>

               <hi>him,</hi> did call him though he anſwered not, did go to the watchmen, and tooke a great deale of paines to recouer him: then ſo muſt wee, if our hearts be in loue with God, care to recouer God by hearing, praying, meditating, conferring, receiuing of the Sacrament, and ſuch other good duties, in which it pleaſeth him to giue vs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his fauour, and the teſtimonie to our ſpirits of his moſt deare preſence.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I learned you how to loue God, that wee may lay a good ground for the dutie of thankefulneſſe, which is to be practiſed by euery one of vs. Now that we
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:655:16"/> may be the better able to practiſe it, you muſt know that it muſt be performed in word and deed. To thanke God for his bleſſings with our tongues, and not to liue anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to them, is no better then to ſay, All hayle King of the Iewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to ſpit vpon him; it is to haue <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſmooth tongue and <hi>Eſau's</hi> rough hands; it is as bad as to giue a man ſweete words for a benefit, and to beate him about the eares: in concluſion, it is after a deale of formall hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, hanged out at the ſigne of the lips, to requite God with euill for good, which is the worſt degree of ingratitude. Firſt wee muſt thanke God in word; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we muſt take the firſt opportunitie to do it: for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes argue no will vnto it. Secondly, we muſt thanke God in worke, for as Phyſitians do paſſe their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mens hearts by their armes (when they feele vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon<note place="margin">Per brachium fit iudicium de corde.</note> their pulſes) and not by their tongues: ſo wiſe men will looke more to doing, then to ſaying (though both are good, and both muſt be done) remembring that <hi>Ieſus</hi>

               <hi>did and ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As concerning that thankes which wee muſt giue to God in word, it ſtands in the practiſe of a double dutie: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is called celebration, the ſecond inuocation. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration is that dutie of thankefulneſſe, whereby we do ſpeake of Gods mercies, and maruellous kindneſſes to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: as when <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Come and hearken all yee that</hi>

Now, for our more conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable practiſe of this dutie, wee muſt obſerue foure rules.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, we muſt (as farre as we can) ſpeake particularly of Gods fauours to vs. Euen vngodly men, being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with Gods kindneſſe, and wallowing daily in the midſt of his mercies, <hi>which are renewed euery morning,</hi> will<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 23.</note> either out of cuſtome, or example, or conuiction ſpeake of them in generall: but wee muſt do it in particular.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, wee muſt ſpeake publickly of them for the generations to come. The Prince muſt ſpeake of them to his ſubiects, the Miniſter to his people, the Maiſter to his ſeruants, one neighbour to another, and the father to his children. As the Iewes are ſaid by the Rabbins, the night before the Paſſouer, to confer with their children on this wiſe: The child ſaid, Why is it called the Paſſeouer? The father anſwered, becauſe the Angell paſſed ouer and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed vs not. The child ſaid, Why do we eate vnleaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread? The father anſwered, becauſe we were forced to make haſte out of Aegypt. The child ſaid againe, Why eate we ſoure hearbes? The father anſwered, to put vs in mind of the affliction in Aegypt: ſo ought wee to deale in all the great and maruellous kindneſſes of God. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, (as I mentioned before,) <hi>Come ye children,</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we muſt ſpeake wiſely of them, that is, ſo as it may eaſily bee diſcerned which fauours wee prize moſt. Worldly men and godly men, will both ſpeake of Gods bleſſing them: but it is (except policy preuent) with as much difference as there was in <hi>Iſaacks</hi> giuing a bleſſing to <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> The worldly man ſaith, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">Geneſ. 27. 28. 39.</note> be God <hi>for the fatneſſe of the eartth, and for the dew of

Thus is he wiſe in ſpeaking of ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings with the higheſt ſtraine; if not alwaies in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet in affection. See it in <hi>Dauid, My ſoule praiſe the</hi>

               <hi>Lord, and all that is within mee praiſe his holy Name: my ſoule praiſe the Lord, and forget not all his benefits, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth all thine iniquity and healeth all thine infirmities.</hi> Here are the chiefe fauours which hee ſpeaketh of, and then he deſcendeth lower: <hi>Which redeemeth thy life from the graue, and which ſatisfieth thy mouth with good things.</hi> This alſo muſt be our courſe. Wee muſt thanke God for outward peace and proſperity, but eſpecially for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: Wee muſt thanke God for our deliuerance from the Plague: but eſpeciall, that he hath giuen vs to know the <hi>Plague in our owne hearts,</hi> and to confeſſe it, and turne<note place="margin">1.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laſtly, we muſt ſpeake conſtantly of them. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God are ſhewed in proſperity and aduerſity; and we muſt ſpeake of them in both eſtates: as <hi>Iob,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>The Lord giueth and the Lord taketh away, bleſſed bee the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 1. 21.</note>

               <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 23.</note> and therefore muſt we ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in the euening, and at noonetide, will I praiſe thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> 
               <hi>of thy righteous iudgements.</hi> Thus haue I taught you how to be thankefull vnto God by Celebration, that is, ſpeaking of Gods praiſes to others.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, we muſt be thankfull vnto God by Inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is that duty of thankfulneſſe, whereby in one branch of Prayer we ſpeake of Gods praiſes to himſelfe: as when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I giue thee thankes, O Father, Lord</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 11. 25.</note> 
               <hi>of Heauen and earth.</hi> Now for the better performance of this duty, we muſt properly doe three things:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, wee muſt humbly acknowledge our owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe of any fauour. It is impoſſible that we ſhould be truly thankfull, till we ſee what Dunghills we are vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:655:18"/> vpon whom God caſteth his beames, and gather our worthineſſe, not by the worth of Gods bleſſings (ſeeing a precious ſtone may be in a Toades head) but by the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious worthineſſe which is in God, who accounts it little enough for him to giue, though it bee too much for vs (as we are our ſelues) to receiue. Hence is it that <hi>Dauid</hi> cryeth out, <hi>What is man that thou ſhouldſt bee mindefull of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 8. 4.</note> 
               <hi>him; and the ſonne of man, that thou ſhouldſt ſo regard him.</hi> And good <hi>Iacob,</hi> when he did ſwimme in Gods fauours, freely confeſſed, <hi>that hee was leſſe then the leaſt of Gods</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 10.</note> 
               <hi>mercies.</hi> Thus ought it to bee with vs. As if wee ſhould ſay, O my God, how vnworthy am I that I ſhould liue, when ſo many haue dyed? that I ſhould abound, when ſo many haue wanted? that I ſhould haue eaſe, when ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue cryed for woe and paine? What am I better then my brethren? No, Lord, I am worſe then many thouſands, who haue made their beds in the darke in this common calamity. Thou knoweſt mine vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and mine iniquity can I not hide, and yet thou haſt beene gracious, and ſo forth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, we muſt amplifie the mercies of God, wee muſt not extenuate the leaſt of them, as if they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, but we muſt make the leaſt of them in the ranke of thoſe which are too great for vs. As <hi>Hannah,</hi> when ſhe had borne her <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſings, <hi>The barren hath borne</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 5.</note> 
               <hi>ſeuen:</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> when hee ſate before the Lord, ſaid, <hi>Who am I, O Lord God, and what is mine houſe that thou</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Chro. 17. 16, 17</note> 
               <hi>haſt brought me hitherto?</hi> yet <hi>thou eſteeming this a ſmall thing, O God, haſt alſo ſpoken concerning the houſe of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant a great while, and haſt regarded mee according to the ſtate of a man of high degree.</hi> Euen thus muſt we doe: as if we ſhould ſay, O bleſſed God, my Father was an Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and my Mother an Hittite, and thou mighteſt haue caſt me into Hell from the wombe, yet thou keptſt mee when I hanged vpon my Mothers breaſt: yea thou haſt brought me vp in a Chriſtian Church, vnder Chriſtian Kings, who haue deſired to ſerue God according to thy
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:655:18"/> Word: yea, and thou haſt continued the Goſpell to mee euen vnto this day: and though I haue beene vnworthy of them, and therefore thou haſt plagued me and mine; yet, as if I had been like King <hi>Dauid,</hi> worth ten thouſand of others, thou haſt kept mee from the common miſery, and ſo forth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we muſt more excellently conceiue of God then we can ſee him in his bleſſings. If the whole world were full of Bookes (as an Ancient ſaith) and all the Creatures writers, and all the water of the Sea Inke; firſt all the Books ſhould be filled, all the Writers wearied, &amp; all the Sea ſhould be exhauſted and drawne dry, before one of Gods perfections could bee abſolutely deſcribed. In which reſpect <hi>Moſes</hi> ſingeth, <hi>Who is like vnto thee, O</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 15. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Lord among the gods! Who is like vnto thee ſo glorious in holineſſe, fearefull in praiſes and doing wonders!</hi> Fearefull in praiſes (ſaith he) becauſe he cannot duly bee praiſed but with aſtoniſhment: according to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>God is very terrible in the aſſembly of the Saints.</hi> And thus<note place="margin">Pſal. 89. 7.</note> ſhould he be to vs in praiſing him. As if wee ſhould ſay, O our God, let not thy fauours ſeeme ordinary vnto vs, which thou beſtoweſt vpon vs. It may ſeeme a ſmall thing to vs, to haue water to our hands, aire to breath in, earth to tread vpon, and the like: but when wee doe conſider who it is that giues, and to whom; that thou art he who art a God of glory, whoſe glory is able to ſwallow vp<note place="margin">Heu miſer quid ſum? vas ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilinij<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concilia putredinis ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus foetore, Auguſt.</note> our vnderſtanding, and that it is to vs, who are a ſinke of ſinne and ſtinking noyſomneſſe before thee, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in our ſelues, and cannot tell which way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thee thankes, which in the leaſt meaſure may anſwer thy loue, and ſo forth.</p>
            <p>Thus haue we conſidered that thankes which we muſt giue to God in word; yet that is not enough, for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth that we bee thankfull vnto God in deeds alſo. And wherein this ſtands we cannot better learne then by looking into thoſe that haue beene thankefull vnto God in the Scriptures. Now theſe haue performed a reall
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:655:19"/> thankfulneſſe vnto God two waies. Firſt, by ſtudying and caring in what particulars they may ſhew themſelues thankfull vnto God. As one that hath receiued a great kindneſſe, doth bethinke himſelfe how hee may in ſome meaſure requite it: ſo will he that is thankfull doe. As<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 11.</note> the penitent man careth for the remiſſion of his ſinnes and eternall happineſſe by Chriſt, and therefore careth alſo to vſe meanes anſwerable thereunto; ſo doth alſo the truly thankfull perſon. See it in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who hauing receiued a great kindneſſe from God ſaith, <hi>What ſhall I</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 12.</note> 
               <hi>giue vnto the Lord?</hi> as if he did conſult and take care with himſelfe how to be thankfull to God. Euen thus muſt it be with vs, we muſt, when wee are by our ſelues alone, take thought and care what to doe, wherein wee may ſhew our ſelues thankfull to God. As a man roles euery ſtone, and takes thought how to liue and beare about the world (as we ſay:) ſo muſt all of vs whom God hath pleaſed to deliuer from theſe dangerous times, either by healing our ſores, or by keeping vs from infection, or by comforting our hearts againſt the feare of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, either at home or abroad, ſay and thinke with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: O Lord, what ſhall I doe? How ſhall I carry my ſelfe in my thoughts, words and actions; yea, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings ſo as may pleaſethee, and I may teſtifie how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I prize thoſe fauours which I haue receiued from thy hands.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Thus we muſt ſtudy, but wee muſt not there leaue (this were but like a daſh of raine which wets not to the root) therefore anſwerable to our care and ſtudy, we muſt in the ſecond place take paines to ſhew our thankfulneſſe in foure particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we muſt regiſter the noble acts of God; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the Pſalme, <hi>This ſhall be written for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations to come.</hi> Hence was it that the Patriarkes ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted<note place="margin">Pſal. 102. 18.</note> Mountaines, builded Altars, and impoſed fit names vpon their children, that they might in theſe things regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the kindneſſe of God vnto them. Therefore as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:655:19"/> 
               <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> did cauſe his deliuerance from <hi>Bigthan</hi> and <hi>Tereſh</hi> to be written in the booke of the Chronicles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Heſt. 2. 22.</note> the King: ſo muſt we haue a record of fauours, that we telling our ſoules that ſuch a yeare God did ſuch a kindneſſe for thee, and ſuch a yeare, moneth, weeke, or day did he another, to day thou haſt receiued one eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his loue, and yeſterday thou diddeſt receiue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; wee may not onely practiſe a dutie of thankfulneſſe in it, but prouoke our ſelues thereby to be thankfull in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times: As <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> his regiſtring of his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance<note place="margin">Heſt. 6.</note> made him afterwards to be thankefull to <hi>Mordecai</hi> who (vnder God) was the author of it. And think we not thus of our ſelues, that there are few who haue done thus before vs. I make no doubt but that thouſands of Gods people, <hi>of whom the world is not worthy,</hi> haue taken this<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> courſe in ſecret, yea and do take it. And of a good man I haue often read, who is ſaid to delight in one booke which he daily carried about him, and was portable enough; for it had but two leaues, one blacke, and the other white: in the black he made a regiſter of his ſinnes, that he might daily be humble, in the white he made a regiſter of Gods mercies that he might be thankfull.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt heartily labour the good of others. For can we requite God himſelfe? we cannot do it, <hi>Our</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.</note> 
               <hi>goodneſſe reacheth not to him:</hi> onely he pleaſeth to interpret ſome ſeruices which he requires as thankfull requitals to himſelfe; amongſt which this is one, to do good to others. Now, this wee muſt do (by way of thankfulneſſe vnto God) both vnto their ſoules and bodies. As for their ſoules wee muſt labour their conuerſion and <hi>turning from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan to God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 26. 18.</note> 
               <hi>that they may receiue forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance amongſt them that are ſanctified by faith in Chriſt.</hi> Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> promiſeth vnto God when he ſaith: <hi>Reſtore to me the ioy of thy ſaluation, and ſtabliſh me with thy free Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>then ſhall I teach thy wayes vnto the wicked, and ſinners ſhall be conuerted vnto thee.</hi> Yea and <hi>Peter</hi> was commanded
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:655:20"/> thus much when Chriſt ſaith vnto him: <hi>When thou art</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 22. 32.</note> 
               <hi>conuerted, ſhew thy thankefulneſſe, by ſtrengthening thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> As for the bodies of others wee muſt relieue (ſo farre <hi>as our ſelves bee not grieued</hi>) the poore members of<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 13.</note> Ieſus Chriſt. For do but marke how it was with the Iewes, when they freely heard the word of God againe, they did eate and drinke, and did <hi>ſend away part</hi> (as they were<note place="margin">Neb. 8. 10. 11. 12</note> commanded) <hi>to thoſe for whom nothing was prepared,</hi> for ioy that they vnderſtood the words which they had taught them. And we may reade of an Apoſtolicall ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of thankfulneſſe in the Primitiue Church to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued euery Lords day, or firſt day of the weeke, that <hi>eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one ſhould put aſide by himſelfe, and lay vp as God had proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 16. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>him,</hi> for the neceſſities of the Saints. Thus alſo muſt it be with vs who haue taſted how good God is, in theſe times of troubles: we muſt throw about theſe our almes both ſpirituall and temporall. Wee muſt labour to do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſoules good, who are within our gate and iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſaying as <hi>Dauid, Come ye children, hearken vnto me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal.</note> 
               <hi>I will teach you the feare of the Lord:</hi> or as <hi>Philip</hi> who had found Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Nathanael. Come and ſee:</hi> we muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 46.</note> to do others bodies good, by thinking who haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured more hardſhip then wee, and who haue endured the more for our flight, and then parting with ſomething to feede the hungrie, cloathe the naked, relieue the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, maintaine the fatherleſſe, and ſet at libertie the honeſt priſoner and captiue, and the like. Thus ſhall wee ſhew the true vſe and iſſue of all our faſting this Sommer, which as the Prophet ſaith, is to looſe <hi>the bands of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay 58. 6. 7.</note> 
               <hi>to take off the heauie burthens, and let the oppreſſed go free, and that ye breake euery yoake. It is to deale thy bread to the hungrie, to bring the poore that wander into thine houſe, to couer the naked and not to hide thy ſelfe from thine owne fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, we muſt renue our couenants and promiſes to God of a more ſincere and hearty obedience. When God had deliuered <hi>Dauid</hi> from <hi>Saul</hi> in the Wilderdeſſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:655:20"/> of <hi>Maon,</hi> he renued his promiſes twice together, That <hi>he would take the Cup of ſaluation,</hi> That <hi>he will offer the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 13. 17.</note> 
               <hi>of praiſe, and call vpon the Name of the Lord.</hi> Thus <hi>Aſa,</hi> when God gaue him victory ouer his enemies and ſetled peace, and the Prophet <hi>Azariah</hi> came and put him in minde of his duty, he and his people <hi>made a couenant</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Chro. 15. 12. 14</note> 
               <hi>to ſeeke the Lord God</hi> of their fathers <hi>with all their hearts, and with all their ſoules,</hi> and they ſware <hi>vnto the Lord with a loud voice,</hi> and with <hi>Trumpets, and ſhouting, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</hi> Thus <hi>Ezra</hi> alſo, and the people who returned from the captiuity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when they were ſenſible of Gods mercy and their owne ſinning, and <hi>while there was</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezra 10 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>hope in Iſrael</hi> (though as yet they trembled for their ſins in the ſtreet of the houſe of God, and for the ruine (as we may doe for the Plague) did make <hi>a couenant with God to put away their heatheniſh wiues,</hi> and liue more holily. Thus muſt it bee with vs alſo; wee muſt bethinke our ſelues wherein we haue offended God, either priuately or publikely, either as Magiſtrates, or Miniſters, or Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, or Wiues, or Maſters, or Seruants, or Fathers, or Children, or Buyers, or Sellers, or Borrowers, or Lenders, or Letters, or Hirers; and we muſt prepare our ſelues for the Lords Supper (with the firſt opportunity) wherein we muſt renue our Couenant with God, humbling our ſelues for the ſinnes we haue committed, and promiſing to God vpon his aſſuring of vs his loue vnto vs in Chriſt Ieſus, that we will be carefull to vſe our beſt endeuours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure of grace which wee haue receiued, to liue more <hi>holily</hi> to God, more <hi>righteouſly</hi> &amp; iuſtly in all<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 12.</note> our dealings with men, and more <hi>ſoberly</hi> in our ſelues: and when we cannot doe ſo much good as we would, that we will lament it to God, and cry out vnto him, ſaying, <hi>Oh that my wayes were ſo direct that I might keepe thy Statutes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, as we muſt renue our Couenant, ſo when wee haue done, we muſt with all our ſtrength (and with an humble dependance vpon the vſe of Gods meanes for more) reſolue and ſettle our bodies and ſoules to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:655:21"/> in it, and neuer ſo to offend ſo good a God as wee haue done in former times. This is true thankfulneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, when out of a feeling of Gods loue, and out of a conſcience of our duty to God, wee can ſay as <hi>Dauid, I</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> 
               <hi>haue ſworne to keepe thy righteous iudgements,</hi> and I haue determined to keepe thy Statutes. Without this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our hearts will <hi>ſtart aſide like a broken Bow,</hi> and our<note place="margin">Pſal.</note> righteouſneſſe will be like a <hi>morning dew,</hi> and like a cloud<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.</note> paſſing away. Therefore (I ſay once more) ſtriue wee to the vtmoſt of that to which God hath enabled vs, and for the reſt pray with <hi>Dauid, Lord, Stabliſh mee by thy free</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> 
               <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is a Spirit of liberty, and will make vs run the way of thy Commandements.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I taught you in ſome meaſure to practiſe this duty of Thankfulneſſe. I pray God giue vs vnderſtanding in all things, and honeſt hearts that we may practiſe this duty now when Gods maruellous kindneſſe calleth for it with ſo loud a voice. And thus I commend you to him, who is of power to eſtabliſh you according to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 25.</note> euen to the God of peace, whom I humbly beſeech to <hi>make you perfect in all good workes, to doe his will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>
